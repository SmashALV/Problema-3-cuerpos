# **App Name**: Celestial Orbits

## Core Features:

- Configuration Generation: Use an AI tool to generate initial conditions for the three-body problem simulation, allowing for diverse orbital configurations.
- Animated Visualization: Visualize the orbital paths of three celestial bodies in an animated simulation.
- Simulation Controls: Implement controls for users to start, stop, and reset the simulation, as well as adjust simulation parameters.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background: Dark, deep space color (#000020) to enhance the visual contrast of the celestial bodies.
- Celestial Bodies: Use distinct, vibrant colors (e.g., #FF4500, #00CED1, #9370DB) for each body to easily differentiate their paths.
- Accent: Light blue (#ADD8E6) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Clean, sans-serif font for the interface elements to ensure readability.
- Simple, intuitive icons for the simulation controls (play, pause, reset).
- A clean and minimalist layout to focus on the visual simulation.
- Smooth, realistic animations for the movement of the celestial bodies.
