# Celestial Simulation Application

This project is a celestial simulation application that allows you to visualize and interact with celestial bodies. It's built using Next.js and provides a dynamic and engaging way to explore the motion of celestial objects.

## Features
* **Interactive Simulation:** Visualize the motion of multiple celestial bodies in a dynamic simulation.
*   **Three Body Problem:** Explore the behavior of three celestial bodies under gravitational forces.
*   **AI-Driven Generation:** Generate initial conditions for your simulation with the help of AI.
*   **Customizable Parameters:** Easily adjust simulation parameters such as mass, velocity, and initial position to create unique celestial scenarios.
*   **Responsive Design:** Enjoy a seamless experience across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones, thanks to its responsive design.
*   **UI Components:** Built with Radix UI, ensuring a modern and accessible user interface.
*   **AI Integration:** Integrates Genkit to provide AI-driven services, enhancing the simulation experience.
* **Multilanguage support**: You can change the language to English or Spanish

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1.  **Node.js**: This project requires Node.js to run the server and build the application.
    *   **Installation**:
        *   Download and install Node.js from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
        *   Make sure to choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability.
    *   **Verification**:
        *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
        *   Type `node -v` and press Enter. This should display the installed Node.js version.
        *   Type `npm -v` and press Enter. This should display the installed npm version.

2.  **npm**: npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js and is used to manage project dependencies.

3.  **Git**: Git is necessary to clone the repository from GitHub.
    *   **Installation**:
        *   If you don't have Git installed, download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).
    * **Verification**:
        * Open your terminal or command prompt.
        * Type `git --version` and press Enter. This should display the installed Git version.

## Installation
Follow these step-by-step instructions to install and run the application on your device:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    *   **Command**: `git clone https://github.com/SmashALV/Problema-3-cuerpos.git`
    *   This command will download the project files to your local machine.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    *   **Command**: `cd Problema-3-cuerpos`
    *   This will change your current directory to the project folder.

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    *   **Command**: `npm install`
    *   This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

4. **Run the development server:**
    * **Command**: `npm run dev`
    *  This will start the development server and watch for any changes in the files.

5. **Open the Application:**
    *  Open your web browser and go to the URL provided in the terminal output (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## Usage
Now that the application is running, you can interact with the simulation:
* Change the simulation language.
* Customize the number of bodies to be simulated
* Change the initial parameters.
* Start or pause the simulation.
* Change the speed of the simulation.
